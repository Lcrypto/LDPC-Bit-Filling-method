# LDPC-Bit-Filling-method
The GitHub repository contains a tool for constructing random Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes using the Bit-Filling method, as described in the article "Designing LDPC Codes Using Bit-Filling" by J. Campellot, D. S. Modhat, and S. Rajagopalant in ICC 2001.

The tool provides an implementation of the Bit-Filling method that generates random LDPC codes with a specified degree distribution. This can be useful for designing LDPC codes with specific properties or for analyzing the performance of existing LDPC codes.

To use the tool, simply provide the desired degree distribution, lenght, girth as input to the MATLAB script. The output will be a randomly generated LDPC code matrix using the Bit-Filling construction method.

Overall, this repository provides a practical tool for generating random LDPC codes using the Bit-Filling method, as described in the research paper by Campellot et al.
